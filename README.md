# Baxter-Peg-in-Hole
Mechatronic Engineering Final Year Project - Peg-in-Hole Manipulation of the Dual-Arm Baxter Robot

The main script is in the peg_insert package, titled *final_peg_insert.py*.

This project developed a hybrid velocity/force control solution to achieve peg-in-hole insertion using the Baxter robot. This is not a robust solution covering all edge cases, but worked for the purpose of submitting the thesis given the time constraints.

Feel free to refer to the Extended Abstract and Thesis files for more detailed information.
